This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description of this web app

This is a magical todo task management web app called `Magical Meminisse` which of the name based on Latin for `memorizing`.

Here is the demo page: [DEMO](https://magical-meminissee.netlify.com/)

Here is how to play with your Magical Meminisse: 

## Installation
You need to have node and npm installed on your computer

## Clone
Clone this repo using git clone https://github.com/yuriko-pixel/Magical_Meminisse.git

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

`npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## What you can do and cannot
 
# What you can do:

1. Create list and create task card into it
2. Delete the task card and list

# What you cannot do (yet):

1. Drag and drop the task to the other list 
2. Delete the task card where that task was not originally created

_Note: I was planning to impletement these "you cannot do" function but didn't have enough time to fix all of them until the deadline of Chingu. So I will fix it oneday._

Enjoy!
